# Validate-Obstacles

The purpose of this notebook is to use openly available LiDAR aerial survey data to validate obstacle data published in the AIP chapter ENR 5.4 (enroute obstacles).

The notebook shows how to convert all elevation and heights back to EGM96.

Obstacles are identified in LiDAR points cloud by filtering and clustering.
