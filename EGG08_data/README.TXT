The egm08_25.gtx file has been generated with GeographicLib

(from http://lists.maptools.org/pipermail/proj/2012-April/006273.html)

GeographicLib now includes an example code, GeoidToGTX, that takes
one of the earth gravity models (egm84, egm96, or egm2008), computes the
geoid heights on a regular grid, and writes the results out as a gtx
file.  See
